						<h3>Video Games</h3>
						<div>
							<p>I enjoy playing and talking about a wide range of video games. Check out the games I most enjoyed and the ones that I am currently playing:</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-pc">
						<h3>Computers</h3>
						<div>
							<p>When it comes to computers I love playing around with them. Be it different displays, motherboards, CPU, GPU, PSU and more. I have always liked working with computers as I grew up surrounded by them. I have built and upgraded over 4 different computers and that has always been a fun experience. I love learning about new developments in the field and figuring out if they are enough of a change for me to care about. In addition to tower PCs I am also into laptops and find them quite interesting. Since I have been traveling so much I have not been able to use a desktop PC myself but instead I have a gaming laptop.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-tech">
						<h3>Technology</h3>
						<div>
							<p>Since my father worked in IT and coding I managed to become familiar with various different pieces of technology as I grew up. This ranged from computers to phones, tablets and more. I have always enjoyed looking at new technology and what they offer, especially if they are able to help me get things done. I would say that I grew up around an era where technology was moving at a rapid pace. New GPUs, CPUs, phones evolving in very interesting ways, music players, introduction of the modern tablet and more. All of these combined made me super interested in technology and to see what else there is coming down the line.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-car">
						<h3>Cars</h3>
						<div>
							<p>Since I was young, something has always attracted me to cars. I have enjoyed pretty much all types of vehicles and understanding how they work. I used to love being able to ride in a car and my love for them grew when I started playing games such as Need For Speed. This love for cars and vehicles grew even more when I started to get steering wheels, pedals and more for racing sims. To this day I am still interested in cars and like going to car meets. I have spent many hours on racing games and I cannot deny the impact the Car movie and Top Gear/Grand Tour hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James May have had in my affection for this hobby.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-eng">
						<h3>Engineering</h3>
						<div>
							<p>Understanding how things work has always been something that I enjoyed. Due to this I liked opening things up or taking things apart to understand their inner workings, and I found myself also enjoying trying to figure out how to put things together or come up with new things. For the longest time I wanted to be an engineer and I just did not know which type. When looking at cars, I would spend hours on end trying to understand how the various different parts worked and how they come together, additionally, I did the same thing with airplanes. I would spend hours on end looking up documents, videos and mornings trying to learn about transmissions, clutches, gears, timing chains and more on my own. To this day I keep this habit of trying to understand how something works, and really enjoying it when engineers come up with simple solutions that solve problems. </p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-tp">
						<h3>Theme Parks</h3>
						<div>
							<p>I have experience going to a few theme parks, but I really do like the attention to detail, storytelling and engineering behind rides and lands. One of the first parks I learned a lot about, including taking a university course, was Disneyland. Disneyland used to be my home park and I always enjoyed learning more about it, such as how they control line of sight, or interesting quirks the park has.</p>
							<p>Some of my favorite rides: </p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-coaster">
						<h3>Roller Coasters</h3>
						<div>
							<p>I only got into roller coasters thanks to a friend when I went to Disneyland. For some reason, I was usually a little scared to go because I thought that it would make me nauseous or sick. However, after riding Space Mountain, my first coaster, and The Matterhorn Bobsleds, my second ever coaster, I found that I quite enjoy them. From that point on I enjoyed going on coasters and have visited various different coasters across multiple different parks.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-photo">
						<h3>Photography</h3>
						<div>
							<p>Photography has always been fun to me. I remember having to make sure I really wanted to take a picture because I only had a limited amount of film. Today, I just take pictures of a wide range of things never thinking twice other than what the shot will look like when I want to make sure I have a good picture. I've lately been taking pictures of cars and bikes for my Instagram</p>

					<div class="hobby-wo">
						<h3>Working Out</h3>
						<div>
							<p>I love hanging at the gym and learning how to workout. I haven't been able to go regularly for more than 3 months at a time. It's not because I don't want to, it’s just that I either get too busy with other work or I am moving and signing up for a membership for a few months is a hassle. Despite that, whenever I do make it to the gym, it's a blast. I would enjoy finding someone to be my gym buddy.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-bike">
						<h3>Bikes</h3>
						<div>
							<p>I have only recently gotten into liking bikes. Most of it has been from watching bike content and interacting with bike people on Discord. Due to me only recently having some interest in bikes I do not know much, but I am always open to talk about it.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-music">
						<h3>Music</h3>
						<div>
							<p>Music has always been a part of my life. Since a young age I’ve been listening to music from all different genres. I recall enjoying dancing and singing as well. My household grew to have a lot of instruments so I started picking up certain instruments more than others. I learned the recorder, keyboard, saxophone, trumpet, bass guitar and guitar. I have had the most experience with the saxophone and have had the chance of playing with many different concert bands from various different parts of the world. Additionally I have had the chance of playing around with other instruments such as violins, flutes, different saxophones and more.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-aviation">
						<h3>Aviation</h3>
						<div>
							<p>Seeing planes go by is something that I love to do. I find it fascinating how we are able to get large pieces of metal and people into the air. My love for aviation started when I got gifted Microsoft Flight Simulator X when I was 9. I enjoyed being able to fly various different planes and learn how each of them worked. I ended up purchasing aircraft that had better systems simulations and that led to learning procedures and how airplanes worked as a whole. Ever since then I have always been engaged in aviation, loving to fly in the sim, seeing the world from a different perspective and understanding the operation and engineering behind the systems.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="hobby-main">
						<h3>Hobbies</h3>
						<div>
							<p>I'm all about investing time in the things I love doing, and I'm always up for meeting new people and expanding my knowledge. I'm keen on learning more about my current hobbies and maybe even picking up a few new ones along the way.</p>
